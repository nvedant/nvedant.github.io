if you are feeling stuck or not having any idea of what to do, build or whatever, i highly recommend just picking something and start working on it, it is kinda weird how it works but once you start working on something you start to notice gaps and problems you wish someone had solved, and that's the thing you probably want to work on.

and again, you might notice some gaps while you work on the problem you encountered and it kind of becomes the loop, or at least that's what i have experienced.

so solution to feeling stuck is simple -- just pick something and start working on it.
